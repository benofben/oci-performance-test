# oci-performance-test

## September 24, 2018
We have Python and CQL scripts.  I'm running those on a single node cluster of the following shapes.  This is using:

| Variable      | Value                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Nodes         | 1                             |
| OS            | Oracle-Linux-7.5-2018.08.14-0 |
| Java          | Oracle jdk-8u181              |
| DataStax      | DSE 4.8.15-1                  |

We're not using jdk-8u152 because it is so old that it's been pulled from the Oracle download site.  Instead, we're using the current 181.

This version of DSE is also extremely old.  Newer versions have far better performance because both the storage engine and file system have been rewritten, resulting is a [3x-10x performance speedup](https://www.datastax.com/2018/06/zdata-benchmark-study-shows-datastax-enterprise-6-outperforms-open-source-apache-cassandra) depending on what you're measuring.

This test is a bit unrepresentative in that it's a single node.  Typical clusters are 3 or more nodes with a replication of three.  Often those are distributed across ADs, though we're actually exploring single AD deployment, leveraging FDs for resilience in OCI.

Typically tests like this use [cassandra-stress](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.1/cassandra/tools/toolsCStress_t.html), not copy.  This performance is unlikely to be indicative of more typical CQL workloads.  I recall a DataStax engineer at one point saying he wouldn't trust a benchmark that was run for less than 24 hours.

Our results are:

| Shape         | Write - Rows/s | Read - Rows/s |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| DenseIO1.8    | 91750          | 5386          |
| DenseIO1.16   | 92569          | 28943         |
| DenseIO2.8    | 85531          | 22711         |
| DenseIO2.16   | 99187,98966    | 48953, 44019  |
